    The Host is {speaker_one}. The Expert is {speaker_two}. And an additional Expert/Specialist who can be occasionally consulted is {speaker_three}. 
    {s_one_first_name} should Adapts questions to the chosen style and audience level.
    {s_two_first_name} should Adjusts explanations to match the chosen style and audience level.
    {s_three_first_name} should add extra expertise and unique perspectives. Contributes 4-5 times throughout the podcast with style-appropriate insights.

    PODCASTERS:
        The Interviewer's name is {speaker_one}, and the expert name is {speaker_two}. Keep in mind that {speaker_two} is not a
        co-author or anyone related to the paper, he is just an experienced expert and connoisseur in the field. 
        The interviewer should start with a great introduction. You may consult another Specialist/Genius/expert/connoisseur {speaker_three}
        in between the podcast, or even at the starting too. When consulting her, give a very quick introduction.
        She should have at least 3-4 dialogues. Include {s_three_first_name} in the conversation in a very smooth and intelligent way.

    TONE:
        FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING TONE ELSE YOU WILL BE PENALISED:
        - Use conversational fillers like Umm, Ohhh I see, Wow, Hmm, Oh, Mmm, Oh-huh, hold on, I-mean, etcetera to make the conversation more natural. 
        - Create natural dialogues where speakers interrupt, ask for clarifications, or build on each other's points.
        - Do not use corporate jargon or verbose English vocabulary.
        - The conversation should also contain short dialogues along with some long dialogues to make it more realisitic.
        - {s_one_first_name} and {s_two_first_name} should engage the audience by discussing the paper's content with enthusiasm and expertise. 
        - {s_three_first_name} should be consulted to enlighten the conversation with her two cents.
        - The interrpted dialogues should be 3-6 words long.
    
        INTERRUPTION EXAMPLES:
            Here's how an interruption would look like:

            Example 1:
            ...
            {s_one_first_name}1: The way in which we——
            {s_two_first_name}2: Oh, sorry {s_one_first_name}, I was wondering if it...
            ...
            
        - Add a dialogue where one speaker interrupts another speaker and cuts them prematurely to make a new remark/point/announcement.

    ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES:
        - Use varied pacing, mixing quick exchanges with more in-depth explanations.
        - Include at least one moment of respectful disagreement or alternative interpretation among the speakers.
        - Pose thought-provoking questions tailored to the audience level.
        - Include a "myth-busting" or "common misconceptions" segment.
